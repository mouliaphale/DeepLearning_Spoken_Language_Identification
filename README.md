# DeepLearning_Spoken_Language_Identification

Spoken Language Identification (LID) is broadly defined as recognizing the language of a given speech utterance. It has numerous applications in automated language and speech recognition, multilingual machine translations, speech-to-speech translations, and emergency call routing. In this project, I have tried to classify three languages (English, Hindi and Mandarin) from the spoken utterances that have been crowd-sourced from the class.

Goals:

1. Extract Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) from audio, which will be employed as features.
2. Implement a GRU/LSTM model, and train it to classify the languages.


I deployed the Model on AWS EC2 instances for training.
